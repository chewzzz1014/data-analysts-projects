## Overview
- One of the graduation projects required for [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python) course.
- [View Instructions on Free Code Camp website.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)

## Summary
- Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

- The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.
